We need volunteers in order to keep the space running. At this time a handful of people are working to build out the space and plan for resources events and workshops. To keep things operating smoothly we're looking for a couple of people to focus their attention on certain aspects of the space. We want to limit these roles to specific scopes to prevent these positions from becoming a burden.

## Workshop Coordinator

Determining scheduling needs for community workshops. Recruiting workshop designers and instructors.

## Working Space Manager

Make sure shared work space hours are not in conflict with other functions.
